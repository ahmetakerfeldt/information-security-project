      <p>One of the easiest ways to prevent email phishing is to have users read the details of the person or company
        sending the email. So let's check the sender of the email you received and then let's make a phishing scam
        together.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: 500">is_disposable_email:</span>
              Indicates the email is not disposable. Disposable emails are often used in phishing attacks. A value of
              "false" suggests the email might be more reliable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: 500">is_free_email:</span>
              Shows the email is from a free provider (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo). Free email services are frequently used in
              phishing but are not a definitive indicator of a threat.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: 500">is_role_email:</span>
              Indicates the email is not role-based. Role-based emails are commonly used in official communications but
              can also be utilized in phishing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: 500">is_catchall_email:</span>
              Indicates the email is not a catch-all email (accepting all emails on the domain). This increases the
              likelihood of it being a real userâ€™s email.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: 500">is_mx_found and is_smtp_valid:</span>
              Shows that the domain's MX record is found and the SMTP server is valid. This means the email technically
              exists and can receive messages. However, phishing emails can also meet these criteria.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: 500">quality_score:</span>
              A high-quality score indicates better email reliability. Low scores are typical in phishing emails, but a
              high score does not eliminate the risk entirely.
